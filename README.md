# Project With Python: Student Performance In Exams With An Exploratory Data Analysis
This project is taken on the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams with a further exploration data analysis method approach to determine the influence of students on exam performance.

From this data, to find out whether there is an influence between parental background and test scores, an analysis is needed including:
1. What educational background took the exam the most and took the exam the least?
2. Show 10 students who got low scores on math, reading, writing tests?
3. Show 10 students who got the highest score on math, reading, writing exams?
4. What educational background got the lowest and highest scores from the average total score obtained?
5. Who gets the highest score from each race/ethnicity group on the educational background of their parents
6. What categories are students most interested in in the lunch column?
7. Is there an effect between the stunting who took the test preparation course and not taking the test on the total score achieved?
8. Is there an influence on the educational background of parents on the total score achieved?
